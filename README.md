## Integrations

Next.js Commerce integrates out-of-the-box with BigCommerce, Shopify, Swell, Saleor and Vendure. We plan to support all major ecommerce backends.

## Request flow
- The client side is making requests to NextJS server.
- NextJS server then fetches from the bettercommerce API and returns the data
- You can observe this by opening network tab, you'll see most of the requests are redirected to hostname/api/REQUEST
- If you inspect the request in pages/api/REQUEST you will see that it is calling a different method from the Bettercommerce API

## Folder Structure
- `assets` - css files used in the application.
- `components` - All the components and utils to use in the app. A general rule of thumb for components design is to use functional components and make them as encapsulated and small as possible.
- `config` - basic store config.
- `framework` - All the functions used to communicate with the API.
- `pages` - This is a special folder used by NextJS. Do not rename this. For every file / folder in page NextJS will create a new page. For example if you put a /hello.tsx in pages, the content will be rendered on hostname/hello. Read more here: https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/pages
- `public` - images and other assets used publicly.
